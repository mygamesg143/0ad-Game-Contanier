0AD Game Docker container

The container under this project is built  so that anyone can “pull” and ‘play it!’ in docker without installing the game in ‘localhost’. “0ad”  is one of the best linux games based on gpu that I have ever come across.  The game is ‘open-source’ and on-par with any of the paid games.

Since my school days, I used to play games on the desktop and developed interest in game development. In recent times, as I am learning Dev-Sec-Ops and I am very new to dockerize the containers, especially the applications / games running on gpu, as POC I ‘given’ a try that resulted in this ‘project’.
